DATASET

General: The data are happiness scores and rankings by country (approximately 160 ranked) based on the Gallup World Poll surveys, for the years 2015 through 2019. The surveys are based on answers to the main life evaluation question being asked in the poll – the Cantril Ladder – with the best possible life being a “10” to the worst possible life being a “0” and then using 6 factors (levels of Economy (GDP per capita), Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Government Corruption) and Generosity) as estimates that contribute or correlate to making life evaluations higher (i.e. happier) in each country.
